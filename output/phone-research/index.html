    <p>So, what do the experts say? Well, it really depends. According to "The Relationship between Cellphone Usage on the Physical and Mental Wellbeing of University Students", people who have high phone usage experience "more changes in mood and feeling low" than people who use their phones less. This isnt suprising, a phone's ability to connect a person with the greater world can have some side effects. I'm sure we've all heard about the term doom scrolling before, going through your social media feed and focusing in on the most horrific and depressing things you can find. Spending long periods of time on your phone can lead you to engaging in mentally destructive activities like that, which contributes towards less general satisfaction in life.</p>
<p>However, we shouldn't take this to mean that high phone usage is unilaterally bad. That same study also found that people with lower cellphone usage "felt more lonelier" when comparerd to those with higher usage rates. As I stated previously, phones connect us together. And that comes with benefits too! Connections with others are obviously very important, and phones can allow you to communicate with others in ways never seen before in history. For some, myself included, the adventure into college can be a very isolating experience. It can be hard to make new connections in a strange and unfamilar environment, but phones can give access to connections that you wouldn't otherwise have. Not to mention the fact that it can help to maintain connections you had back at home. It's easy to drift away from people who you never see in person, and hardly get the chance to talk to. But with your phone, you have the ability to communicate with those people, no matter where you both are.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think this goes to show that phone usage is a mixed bag. If used obsessively, or in ways that make you upset or uncomfortable, phones can really damage your mental health. However, as I have been saying, phone usage is about finding a balance that make you the happiest. If you find yourself to be the type who ends up disconnected from the world and what makes you happy when using the phone then yes, it makes sense to reduce your usage. If you find that time on your phone is fulfilling and makes you happy, then great! There's no reason to arbitrarily decide that the usage is suddenly harmful just because thats the case for others. Everyone is different, and what makes others happier may very well make you miserable.</p>
