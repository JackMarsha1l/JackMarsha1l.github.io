As you may have already guessed, I didn't exactly love doing this experiment. I use my phone very frequently, and trying to restrict myself from using it was a massive hassle. However, thats exactly what made this a great experiment! I wasn't just doing something I knew would make my life better, I was trying to find out exactly how my phone usage impacts my life. The fact that I failed to get my time under an hour just proves that it impacts my life A LOT, and that by itself is something noteworthy.

But I guess the bigger question is whether or not that impact was a positive or negative one. Perhaps this is just the addiction talking, but I would argue it was largely negative. As I said above, it was just a hassle to constantly remind myself to not use my phone. Obviously that's pretty annoying. But one of the bigger issues for me was the silence of it all. I listen music and watch videos very frequently to fill up my free time, and without those things it felt very quiet. 

The bigger problem though, is that this reduced phone usage *didn't even make me get more work done.* In fact, I did more work on both the week before the experiment and the week after. It probably just comes down to the ways in which I use my phone. Yes, I use it very often. But normally thats during times of day that would otherwise be filled up with nothing but waiting. Meaning time I would usually just be wasting I instead use to relax, which gives me time later in the day to get work done. I'm not going to claim that its a perfect system, but removing my phone from the equation seemed to only make things worse. 

So what does this mean exactly? Well, I think it goes to show that high screen usage doesn't automatically mean you're wasting tons of time. Your phone can be valuable in converting otherwise empty time into relaxing experiences. Of course, theres a balance. You don't want to let your phone start creeping into the times of day where you *need* to get other stuff done. For some, a reduction in phone time could potentially make them a lot more productive. But that isn't always the case, and you shouldn't feel ashamed of using your phone if you're doing the work you have to be doing.
